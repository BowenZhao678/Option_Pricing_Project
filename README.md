# Options Pricing and Volatility Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes 5 years of Amazon (AMZN) stock and option data to study how differences between implied volatility (IV) and historical volatility (HV) affect option pricing and strategy profitability. Using Python, Excel, and standard financial models, the project identifies periods when options may be overpriced or underpriced and evaluates several option strategies under different volatility conditions.

## Project Goals

- Measure daily returns and market volatility using 5 years of AMZN data  
- Compare implied volatility from option prices with historical volatility  
- Identify volatility gaps that indicate potential mispricing  
- Evaluate how option strategy performance changes when IV differs from HV  

## Key Findings

- Found 10–20 percent differences between implied and historical volatility  
- Identified periods where options appeared overpriced or underpriced  
- Analyzed several option strategies, including covered calls, long straddles, and volatility-based trades  
- Observed that strategy performance changed meaningfully depending on IV–HV differences  

## Methods and Tools

- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance  
- Excel for data cleaning and supplemental calculations  
- Models and calculations used:
  - Black–Scholes model for implied volatility  
  - Daily log returns and realized volatility  
  - Volatility comparison metrics  
- Data source:
  - Five years of AMZN historical price and option chain data  

## Visualizations Included

- Daily returns  
- Historical volatility  
- Implied vs. historical volatility comparisons  
- Profitability of strategies under different volatility regimes  

## Files Included

- Python notebook or script containing analysis code  
- PDF report summarizing methods and findings  
- PowerPoint presentation used for communicating results
